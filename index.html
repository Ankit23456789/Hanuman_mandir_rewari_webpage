                It is believed that a devotee of Pawanputra Hanuman was carrying the idol of Hanuman from
                Rajasthan to Delhi in a bullock cart. When that devotee reached the fast lake of Rewari, when he started leaving after resting, the
                bullock cart did not even budge. He beat the bullocks a lot but the bull did not even move, then that devotee knowing Hanuman's
                wish and installed the idol here.Since then till today this idol of Ram devotee Hanuman has remained the center of faith. Due to
                the continuous flow of Triveni of reverence, faith and belief, today a beautiful temple stands in place of the idol installed
                under the bar. From the establishment of the idol till date, the Mahant family has been looking after this temple. The priest of the
                temple, Pandit Narendra Sharma explains that there are two idols of Hanuman in this temple. If a ball-kunja offered by a devotee remains on the thumb of
                the smaller idol, then it is understood that Bajrangi definitely crosses its boat. Apart from this, vermilion is also
                offered. It is believed that Baba does not let him go empty handed if he makes a vow by offering Bundi's prasad and shells and bows etc. to the
                idol of Hanuman. Therefore, every Tuesday, devotees from far and wide come and offer prasad and flag to the Hanuman temple located on the big pond.
